The folder contains a project that I completed in my Database Design course this last fall, and the individual file, request_example.py is a quick example that I wrote up to display my Python formatting style.


The project is not my best work, but we were on a serious time crunch as a group and the application was not the main focus of the assignment. The individual file is a much better look at my formatting and styling of python code.
